# Embedded Systems and RoboticsðŸ¤–

Iâ€™m a robotics and embedded systems engineer with a deep passion for building intelligent machines that bridge the gap between hardware and software. Thereâ€™s something incredibly exciting about bringing an idea to lifeâ€”designing circuits, writing firmware, and watching a system work exactly as intended (or sometimes figuring out why it doesnâ€™t!).

My journey into robotics started with curiosity and a hands-on approach. One of my most memorable projects was building my first Mars rover, Daruka. At the time, I was still figuring things out, experimenting with different microcontrollers, designing PCBs, and troubleshooting endless hardware issues. But through that process, I learned what it really takes to make a system reliable and efficient. That experience shaped the way I approach every projectâ€”whether it's fine-tuning real-time motor control, optimizing embedded systems, or working on autonomous navigation.

For me, robotics isnâ€™t just about technologyâ€”itâ€™s about problem-solving, innovation, and the excitement of creating something that interacts with the world. Whether Iâ€™m designing a new PCB, debugging firmware, or exploring new ideas, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.

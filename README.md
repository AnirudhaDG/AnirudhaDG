# Embedded Systems and Robotics🤖

I’m a robotics and embedded systems engineer with a deep passion for building intelligent machines that bridge the gap between hardware and software. There’s something incredibly exciting about bringing an idea to life—designing circuits, writing firmware, and watching a system work exactly as intended (or sometimes figuring out why it doesn’t!).

For me, robotics isn’t just about technology—it’s about problem-solving, innovation, and the excitement of creating something that interacts with the world. Whether I’m designing a new PCB, debugging firmware, or exploring new ideas, I’m always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what’s possible.
